# PokemonDatabase
I set up a relational database for Pokemon data on my computer and conducted data analysis of it.

See Pokemon Database Creation for how I created the database on a local server using MySQL Workbench, python, pandas, and SQLAlchemy.

To see visualization of the Pokemon data, please see Pokemon Data Visualizations. I used matplotlib, pandas, and SQL queries to extract interesting information about Pokemon data.

NOTE: Although the Pokemon table contains all Pokemon up to and including Gen VIII, the move and moveset tables are only up to date up to and including Gen VII.
