# PokemonDatabase
I designed and implemented a relational database for Pokemon data and conducted data analysis on it.

See Pokemon Database Creation for how I created the database on a local server using MySQL Workbench, python, pandas, and SQLAlchemy.

To see the initial exploratory data analysis along with many visualizations, please see Eploratory Analysis of Pokemon Data. I used matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, and SQL queries to extract interesting information about Pokemon data and present it nicely. Note: Some Pandas coloring doesn't seem to load properly in brower. 

To see statistical modeling of the data, pleae see Statistical Modeling of Pokemon Data. I used all the same libraries above and added sklearn in order to train a statistical model to predict various attributes of Pokemond data.

Note on the data: Although the Pokemon table contains all Pokemon up to and including Gen VIII, the move and moveset tables are only up to date up to and including Gen VII.
